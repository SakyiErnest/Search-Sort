Make sure you've Java FX SDK installed on your local machine. However, if you don't have it installed follow the instructions below to get it installed and running.

Download JavaFX SDK: Visit the OpenJFX website (https://openjfx.io/) to download the JavaFX SDK. Choose the version that matches your Java Development Kit (JDK) version.

Install JavaFX SDK: Extract the downloaded JavaFX SDK to a directory of your choice. Remember the location as you'll need it later.

Configure your IDE: If you're using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans, you need to configure it to recognize and use JavaFX.

This typically involves setting the JavaFX library path or adding the JavaFX modules to your project's build path. Refer to your IDE's documentation for specific instructions.

Set JavaFX module dependencies: In your Java project, you need to specify the JavaFX module dependencies. The required modules include javafx.controls, javafx.fxml, and others depending on your application's needs. 
The exact steps to set the module dependencies vary depending on your development environment.
Consult your IDE's documentation or build tool (such as Gradle or Maven) documentation for detailed instructions.
